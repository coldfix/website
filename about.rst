About
=====

Welcome to my website!

I am a physicist, enthusiast programmer and free software cultist, and I
created this place mostly to remind me about things I learned the hard way,
and to document the solution for certain recurring problems or tasks. It is
also my hope that some of these lessons might later be useful not only to me
but to others as well.

The best way to reach me is via email_ or github_. My postal address is as
follows:

    | Thomas Gläßle
