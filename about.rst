About
=====

Welcome to my website!

My name is Thomas and I'm a grumpy barefooted gnome, long-term physics
student, dethusiast programmer and free software cultist — yes, I actually
have a robe to perform sacraficial rituals.

As you might have already noticed I am utterly clueless about design and
typography. In case this website makes your eyes cringe you are welcome to
send me your well-meaning suggestions.

The best way to reach me is via email_ or github_. Though, in case you want to
persue me legally (eye cancer?), this is how I am known to the authorities:

    | Thomas Gläßle
    | Bachstr. 34
    | 69121 Dossenheim
    | — Germany

Of course, the above address can also be used as write-only cache to store
fabulous presents *wink*.
