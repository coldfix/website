about me
========

Welcome to my website. I am Thomas, a grumpy barefooted gnome, long-term
physics student, dethusiast programmer and free software cultist — yes, I
actually have a robe to perform sacraficial rituals.

As you might have already noticed, I am utterly clueless about design and
typography. If you feel close to getting eye-cancer by looking at this
website you are welcome to send me your well-meaning suggestions.

The best way to reach me is via email_ or github_. Though, in case you want
to persue me legally, this is how I am known to the authorities:

    | Thomas Gläßle
    | Kaiser-Joseph-Str. 234
    | 79098 Freiburg im Breisgau
    | — Germany

Of course, the above address can also be used as write-only cache for
fabulous every-day presents *wink*.
